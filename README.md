# Big Data Project 2

This project was completed as part of a Big Data Technology course at Hunter College (CSCI 493.76). 

The project involved analyzing data from the Hetio dataset using MapReduce and hashing techniques. Specifically, the project computed the number of genes that bind to compounds (CbG) and the number of genes that upregulate diseases (DuG). 
Additionally, hash tables were constructed using the mid-square method and folding method to evaluate storage efficiency.

### Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas (python library)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Hetio Dataset
